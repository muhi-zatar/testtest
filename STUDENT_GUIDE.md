# Student Guide: Electricity Market Game

Welcome to the Electricity Market Game! You'll manage a utility company over 10 years, making strategic decisions about power plant investments and competing in electricity markets.

## üéØ Your Mission

As a utility company CEO, your goals are:
1. **Maximize shareholder value** through profitable operations
2. **Maintain reliable electricity supply** for customers
3. **Adapt to changing market conditions** and regulations
4. **Build a sustainable portfolio** for the future
5. **Outperform your competitors** over the 10-year simulation

## üè¢ Getting Started

### 1. Login Process
1. Go to the game website
2. Select **"Utility Mode"**
3. Choose your assigned utility company
4. You'll see your dashboard with starting portfolio

### 2. Understanding Your Dashboard
**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- **Available Budget**: Cash for new investments
- **Total Capacity**: Your power generation capability
- **Portfolio Value**: Total investment in plants
- **Market Revenue**: Income from electricity sales

**Financial Health Indicators:**
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Keep below 2.0 for good credit
- **Credit Rating**: AAA (best) to BBB (acceptable)
- **Annual Fixed Costs**: Ongoing plant maintenance
- **Capacity Factor**: How efficiently you use your plants

## üè≠ Understanding Your Power Plants

### Plant Types in Your Portfolio

**Baseload Plants (Run Continuously)**
- **Coal**: Cheap to run but high emissions
- **Nuclear**: Very reliable but expensive to build
- **Natural Gas Combined Cycle**: Efficient and flexible

**Peaking Plants (Run During High Demand)**
- **Natural Gas Combustion Turbine**: Fast-starting for peak hours
- **Battery Storage**: Can charge and discharge quickly

**Renewable Plants (Weather Dependent)**
- **Solar**: Generates during sunny daytime hours
- **Wind**: Generates when wind conditions are favorable

### Key Plant Metrics
- **Capacity (MW)**: Maximum power output
- **Capacity Factor**: Percentage of time plant runs at full power
- **Fixed O&M**: Annual maintenance costs regardless of operation
- **Variable O&M**: Costs per MWh of electricity generated
- **Heat Rate**: Fuel efficiency (lower is better)
- **Fuel Type**: Coal, natural gas, uranium, or none (renewables)

## üí∞ Financial Management

### Your Budget
- **Starting Budget**: $1.5-2.0 billion
- **Debt Capacity**: Can borrow up to 2x your equity
- **Investment Financing**: Typically 70% debt, 30% equity

### Investment Analysis
**Before building new plants, consider:**
1. **Capital Cost**: Upfront construction cost
2. **Construction Time**: 1-7 years depending on technology
3. **Operating Costs**: Annual fixed and variable costs
4. **Revenue Potential**: Expected electricity sales
5. **ROI Timeline**: When investment pays back

### Credit Rating Impact
- **AAA (D/E < 1.0)**: Lowest borrowing costs, maximum flexibility
- **AA (D/E < 1.5)**: Good credit, reasonable borrowing costs
- **A (D/E < 2.0)**: Acceptable credit, higher borrowing costs
- **BBB (D/E > 2.0)**: Poor credit, limited investment capacity

## ‚ö° Electricity Markets Explained

### Load Periods
Instead of 8760 hours per year, the game uses 3 simplified periods:

**Off-Peak (5,000 hours/year)**
- Nights and weekends
- Low electricity demand
- Typically lowest prices
- Baseload plants usually run

**Shoulder (2,500 hours/year)**
- Daytime non-peak hours
- Medium electricity demand
- Moderate prices
- Mix of baseload and flexible plants

**Peak (1,260 hours/year)**
- Evening high-demand hours
- Highest electricity demand
- Typically highest prices
- All available plants may run

### How Markets Work
1. **Merit Order**: Plants bid in order of cost (lowest first)
2. **Marginal Pricing**: All plants receive the price of the last (most expensive) plant needed
3. **Capacity Factor Impact**: Weather and maintenance affect how much plants actually generate

## üìù Bidding Strategy

### Annual Bidding Process
Each year, you submit bids for all your plants across all three load periods.

**For Each Plant and Period, Specify:**
- **Quantity (MW)**: How much capacity you're offering
- **Price ($/MWh)**: Your minimum acceptable price

### Pricing Strategy
**Calculate Marginal Cost:**
1. **Variable O&M**: Direct operating costs
2. **Fuel Cost**: (Heat Rate √ó Fuel Price) √∑ 1000
3. **Carbon Cost**: Emissions √ó Carbon Price
4. **Total Marginal Cost**: Sum of above

**Set Bid Price:**
- **Minimum**: Marginal cost (break-even)
- **Target**: Marginal cost + 10-30% markup
- **Maximum**: Consider market competition

### Bidding Tips
- **Off-Peak**: Lower prices, focus on baseload plants
- **Shoulder**: Moderate prices, include flexible plants
- **Peak**: Higher prices, bid all available capacity
- **Competition**: Price aggressively but stay profitable
- **Fuel Costs**: Adjust bids when fuel prices change
