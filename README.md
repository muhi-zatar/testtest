## üí∞ Financial Model

### Starting Conditions
- Each utility begins with **$1.5-2.0B budget**
- **70% debt / 30% equity** financing for new investments
- Existing portfolio of 3-5 operating plants

### Key Metrics
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Affects credit rating and investment capacity
- **Capacity Factor**: Determines plant utilization and revenue
- **ROI Analysis**: 10-year cash flow projections for investments
- **Credit Rating**: AAA (D/E < 1.0) to BBB (D/E > 2.0)

### Revenue Model
- Revenue = Capacity √ó Hours √ó Clearing Price √ó Capacity Factor
- Costs = Fixed O&M + Variable O&M + Fuel Costs + Carbon Costs
- Profit = Revenue - Costs - Debt Service

## üìä Game Mechanics

### Load Periods
The game uses 3 simplified load periods instead of 8760 hours:

- **Off-Peak** (5,000 hours): Low demand, typically nights and weekends
- **Shoulder** (2,500 hours): Medium demand, daytime non-peak hours  
- **Peak** (1,260 hours): High demand, evening hours with premium pricing

### Market Clearing
- **Merit Order Dispatch**: Plants bid by price, lowest cost serves first
- **Marginal Pricing**: All accepted bids receive the clearing price
- **Annual Bidding**: Submit yearly bids for all three periods

### Market Events
Instructors can trigger realistic events:
- **Fuel Price Shocks**: Natural gas supply disruptions
- **Weather Events**: Droughts affecting renewables

- Check browser console for API errors
- Try refreshing the page or restarting the backend

**Game session not found**
- Clear browser localStorage and restart
- Create a new game session from instructor mode
- Verify the backend database is properly initialized

**Bidding not working**
- Ensure game state is "bidding_open"
- Check that plants are in "operating" status
- Verify bid prices are greater than zero

**Market clearing fails**
- Ensure at least one utility has submitted bids
- Check that bid quantities are positive
- Verify game session state allows market clearing

### Performance Optimization
- Use Chrome or Firefox for best performance
- Close unused browser tabs during gameplay
- Restart backend server if response times slow
- Clear browser cache if experiencing display issues
