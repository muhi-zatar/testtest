# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about the Electricity Market Game.

## üéØ General Questions

### What is the Electricity Market Game?
The Electricity Market Game is an educational simulation where students manage utility companies over a 10-year period. Players make strategic investment decisions, bid in electricity markets, and compete against other utilities while learning about energy economics, policy, and strategic planning.

### Who is this game designed for?
- **University students** in energy economics, public policy, business strategy, and environmental studies courses
- **Professional training** for utility companies, energy consultants, and policy makers
- **Executive education** in MBA programs and leadership development
- **Researchers** studying decision-making and market design

### How long does a game session take?
- **Quick Demo**: 30-45 minutes (2-3 simulation years)
- **Standard Session**: 3-4 hours (complete 10-year simulation)
- **Extended Format**: Multiple 1-2 hour sessions over several weeks
- **Semester Integration**: 15-20 minutes weekly throughout a course

### How many players can participate?
- **Minimum**: 2 utilities (can be individuals or teams)
- **Optimal**: 3-4 utilities for good competition
- **Maximum**: 8 utilities per game session
- **Classroom Size**: 20-30 students (working in teams of 3-5)

## üéÆ Gameplay Questions

### How realistic is the simulation?
The game uses authentic data and principles:
- **Plant costs** from EIA and NREL databases
- **Market mechanics** based on real electricity markets
- **Financial modeling** reflects actual utility practices
- **Policy scenarios** mirror real regulatory environments
- **Technology data** from industry sources and academic research

### Why only 3 load periods instead of 8760 hours?
The simplified structure focuses on strategic decision-making rather than operational complexity:
- **Educational Focus**: Emphasizes long-term planning over short-term operations
- **Time Management**: Allows completion in classroom timeframes
- **Concept Clarity**: Makes market dynamics easier to understand
- **Strategic Emphasis**: Highlights capacity planning and investment decisions

### How are electricity prices determined?
The game uses **merit order dispatch** and **marginal pricing**:
1. All plants bid their minimum acceptable price
2. Bids are sorted from lowest to highest cost
3. Cheapest plants are selected first until demand is met
4. The last (most expensive) plant needed sets the market price
5. All selected plants receive this "clearing price"

### What happens if I make bad decisions?
- **Learning Opportunity**: Mistakes are valuable for understanding market dynamics
- **Recovery Possible**: You can adapt strategy in subsequent years
- **Competitive Impact**: Poor decisions may hurt your ranking but enhance learning
- **Real Consequences**: Financial stress limits future investment options
- **Educational Value**: Failure teaches risk management and strategic thinking

## üè≠ Technology Questions

### Which power plant technology is best?
There's no single "best" technology - each serves different purposes:
- **Coal**: Low operating cost but high emissions and carbon costs
- **Natural Gas**: Flexible and moderate cost but fuel price risk
- **Nuclear**: Very reliable and clean but expensive and slow to build
- **Solar/Wind**: Clean and increasingly cheap but weather dependent
- **Battery**: Valuable for peak periods but limited duration
- **Strategy**: Diversification across technologies reduces risk

### How do I calculate return on investment (ROI)?
The game provides ROI calculators, but the basic formula is:
```
Annual Cash Flow = Revenue - Operating Costs - Debt Service
ROI = (Total Cash Flows over Plant Life) / Initial Investment
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow
```

### Why do renewable plants have low capacity factors?
Capacity factor reflects real-world performance:
- **Solar**: Only generates during daylight hours (~27% average)
- **Wind**: Depends on wind patterns (~35% onshore, ~45% offshore)
- **Coal/Nuclear**: Can run continuously (~85-92%)
- **Gas Turbines**: Often used only for peak periods (~15-87%)

### How does carbon pricing affect my strategy?
Carbon pricing adds costs to fossil fuel plants:
- **Coal**: ~$48/MWh additional cost at $50/ton CO‚ÇÇ
- **Natural Gas**: ~$18-28/MWh additional cost
- **Nuclear/Renewables**: No carbon cost (competitive advantage)
- **Strategy**: Higher carbon prices favor clean technologies

## üí∞ Financial Questions

### How much budget do I start with?
- **Typical Range**: $1.5-2.0 billion per utility
- **Existing Assets**: You start with 3-5 operating plants worth $1-2 billion
- **Available Cash**: Usually $500M-1B for new investments
- **Debt Capacity**: Can borrow up to 2x your equity (70% debt financing typical)

### What if I run out of money?
- **Investment Limits**: You can't build new plants without adequate budget
- **Debt Constraints**: High debt-to-equity ratios limit borrowing capacity
- **Credit Rating**: Poor financial health increases borrowing costs
- **Recovery**: Focus on optimizing existing plants and improving cash flow
- **Strategy**: Conservative financial management prevents this situation

### How does financing work?
Utility investments typically use:
- **70% Debt Financing**: Borrowed money with interest payments
- **30% Equity Financing**: Your cash investment
- **Credit Rating**: Affects interest rates and borrowing capacity
- **Debt Service**: Annual payments reduce cash flow
- **Financial Health**: Debt-to-equity ratio impacts future investment capacity

### What's a good debt-to-equity ratio?
- **AAA (< 1.0)**: Excellent financial health, maximum flexibility
- **AA (< 1.5)**: Good financial health, reasonable borrowing costs
- **A (< 2.0)**: Acceptable financial health, higher borrowing costs
- **BBB (> 2.0)**: Poor financial health, limited investment capacity
- **Target**: Most utilities aim for 1.0-1.5 for optimal balance

## üìä Market Questions

### Why are my bids not being accepted?
Common reasons:
- **Price Too High**: Your bid price exceeds the market clearing price
- **Insufficient Capacity**: You're not bidding enough quantity
- **Market Timing**: Demand is lower than expected
- **Competition**: Other utilities are bidding more aggressively
- **Solution**: Use the marginal cost calculator and price competitively

### How do I know what price to bid?
**Calculate Marginal Cost:**
1. Variable O&M costs (always included)
2. Fuel costs (heat rate √ó fuel price √∑ 1000)
3. Carbon costs (emissions rate √ó carbon price)
4. **Bid Price**: Marginal cost + profit margin (10-30%)

**Market Strategy:**
- **Off-Peak**: Conservative pricing, focus on baseload plants
- **Shoulder**: Moderate pricing, include flexible plants
- **Peak**: Aggressive pricing, bid all available capacity

### What causes electricity prices to change?
- **Supply-Demand Balance**: More/less capacity relative to demand
- **Fuel Prices**: Higher gas/coal costs increase marginal costs
- **Carbon Pricing**: Emissions costs affect fossil plant competitiveness
- **Weather Events**: Renewable availability changes supply mix
- **Plant Outages**: Reduced capacity increases prices
- **Market Events**: Instructor-triggered scenarios create volatility

### How do market events work?
Instructors can trigger realistic events:
- **Fuel Shocks**: Natural gas supply disruptions increase costs
- **Weather Events**: Droughts or storms affect renewable generation
- **Plant Outages**: Equipment failures reduce available capacity
- **Policy Changes**: Carbon price increases or renewable mandates
- **Demand Surges**: Heat waves or economic growth increase demand
