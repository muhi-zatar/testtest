Your complete guide to succeeding in the Electricity Market Game.

## üéØ Welcome to the Energy Industry!

Congratulations! You've been appointed as the CEO of a major utility company. Over the next 10 years (2025-2035), you'll make strategic decisions that will determine your company's success in the competitive electricity market.

### Your Mission
- **Maximize shareholder value** through profitable operations
- **Maintain reliable electricity supply** for customers  
- **Adapt to changing market conditions** and regulations
- **Build a sustainable portfolio** for the future

- **Real Policy Challenges**: Carbon pricing and renewable integration
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Strategic interaction with other utilities

## üè¢ Understanding Your Company

### Starting Position
When you begin, your utility company has:
- **$1.5-2.0 billion budget** for new investments
- **Existing portfolio** of 3-5 operating power plants
- **Established market position** with existing customers
- **Credit rating** that affects your borrowing costs
- **Competitive position** relative to other utilities

### Key Financial Metrics

**Budget & Cash Flow**
- **Available Budget**: Cash available for new investments
- **Annual Revenue**: Income from electricity sales
- **Annual Costs**: Fixed operations, maintenance, fuel, and debt service
- **Net Profit**: Revenue minus all costs

**Balance Sheet Health**
- **Total Assets**: Cash + plant investments
- **Total Debt**: Money borrowed for plant construction
- **Equity**: Your ownership stake in the company
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Key measure of financial health

**Credit Rating Scale**
- **AAA (D/E < 1.0)**: Excellent credit, lowest borrowing costs
- **AA (D/E < 1.5)**: Good credit, reasonable borrowing costs  
- **A (D/E < 2.0)**: Acceptable credit, higher borrowing costs
- **BBB (D/E > 2.0)**: Poor credit, limited investment capacity

## ‚ö° Electricity Market Basics

### How Electricity Markets Work

**Merit Order Dispatch**
1. All plants bid their minimum acceptable price
2. Bids are sorted from lowest to highest price
3. Cheapest plants are selected first until demand is met
4. The last (most expensive) plant needed sets the market price
5. All selected plants receive this "clearing price"

**Load Periods (Simplified)**
Instead of 8760 hours per year, the game uses 3 periods:

**Off-Peak (5,000 hours/year)**
- **When**: Nights (11 PM - 7 AM) and weekends
- **Demand**: Low (1,200 MW average)
- **Characteristics**: Lowest prices, baseload plants run
- **Strategy**: Focus on low-cost, efficient generation

**Shoulder (2,500 hours/year)**  
- **When**: Daytime non-peak (7 AM - 5 PM weekdays)
- **Demand**: Medium (1,800 MW average)
- **Characteristics**: Moderate prices, mix of plants
- **Strategy**: Balance efficiency with flexibility

**Peak (1,260 hours/year)**
- **When**: Evening high-demand (5 PM - 11 PM weekdays)
- **Demand**: High (2,400 MW average)  
- **Characteristics**: Highest prices, all plants may run
- **Strategy**: Maximize capacity availability

### Revenue Calculation
```
Annual Revenue = Œ£(Capacity √ó Hours √ó Clearing Price √ó Capacity Factor)

Where:
- Capacity = Your plant's maximum output (MW)
- Hours = Hours in each period (5000, 2500, 1260)
- Clearing Price = Market price for that period ($/MWh)
- Capacity Factor = How often your plant actually runs (0-1)
```

## üè≠ Power Plant Technologies

### Baseload Plants (Run Continuously)

**Coal Plants**
- **Capital Cost**: $4,500/kW (expensive to build)
- **Operating Cost**: Low fuel cost, high emissions
- **Best Use**: Continuous operation, low-cost electricity
- **Considerations**: High CO‚ÇÇ emissions, carbon pricing impact
- **Strategy**: Good for off-peak and shoulder periods

**Nuclear Plants**

3. **Carbon Cost**: Emissions Rate √ó Carbon Price ($/MWh)
4. **Total Marginal Cost**: Sum of above components

**Set Bid Prices:**
- **Minimum**: Marginal cost (break-even point)
- **Target**: Marginal cost + 10-30% markup for profit
- **Maximum**: Consider competitive dynamics

**Period-Specific Strategy:**
- **Off-Peak**: Conservative pricing, focus on baseload plants
