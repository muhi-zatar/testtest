## üìä Game Mechanics

### Load Periods Explained
Instead of modeling all 8760 hours, the game uses 3 simplified periods:

**Off-Peak (5,000 hours/year)**
- **When**: Nights (11 PM - 7 AM), weekends
- **Demand**: Low (1,200 MW average)
- **Pricing**: Typically lowest prices
- **Strategy**: Baseload plants, low-cost generation

**Shoulder (2,500 hours/year)**
- **When**: Daytime non-peak (7 AM - 5 PM weekdays)
- **Demand**: Medium (1,800 MW average)
- **Pricing**: Moderate prices
- **Strategy**: Mix of baseload and flexible plants

**Peak (1,260 hours/year)**
- **When**: Evening high-demand (5 PM - 11 PM weekdays)
- **Demand**: High (2,400 MW average)
- **Pricing**: Highest prices, premium opportunities
- **Strategy**: All available capacity, peaking plants

### Financial Model

**Starting Conditions**
- $1.5-2.0B initial budget per utility
- Existing portfolio of 3-5 operating plants
- Realistic debt-to-equity ratios

**Investment Financing**
- 70% debt financing (typical utility structure)
- 30% equity requirement from budget
- Credit rating affects borrowing costs
- Debt-to-equity ratio impacts investment capacity

**Revenue Calculation**
```
Annual Revenue = Œ£(Capacity √ó Hours √ó Clearing Price √ó Capacity Factor)
Annual Costs = Fixed O&M + Variable O&M + Fuel Costs + Carbon Costs
Annual Profit = Revenue - Costs - Debt Service
```

### Market Clearing Process
1. **Merit Order**: Bids sorted by price (lowest first)
2. **Demand Matching**: Accept bids until demand is met
3. **Marginal Pricing**: All accepted bids receive clearing price
4. **Revenue Distribution**: Calculate payments to utilities
